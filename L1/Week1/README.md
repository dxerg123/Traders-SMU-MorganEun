# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

*Morgan Eun*  
*meun@smu.edu*  
*Level 1 (Junior)*

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

*I was drawn to quantitative finance due to its combination of computer science, trading concepts, and mathematics which are among my own relevant personal interests. I have relevant coursework in calculus III, honors macro/microeconomics (SMU), IB mathematics analysis and approaches, and am currently taking statistics (SMU). I received second place in the project destined division during December representing team Invesco in which I helped construct a financial model to determine the debt/equity ratio for a hypothetical aquisition of a property. During my senior year of high school, I researched a more compact inhaler prototype than the leading ProAir models using integral optimization.*
*In terms of trading experience, I hold some coins and paper trade on WeBull. I have a couple stocks but am continuing to test my financial risk adversity. Honestly, my conversations with peers inspired me to consider a role in quantitative finance*

## 2. Career Goals

*In terms of quant, I am interested in quantative trading. I'm interested in Citadel, but I am primarily pursuing private equity, credit, and mortgage/loan markets. I am currently participating in a bridge program for Annaly Capital Management where I am guaranteed a first round interview for their 2026 analyst position. I am also interested in Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Revantage, and Fortress. I am interested in energy finance, but I will likely pursue it for personal investment and not as a professional specialization.*
*In 1-2 years, I hope to break into private equity or a related field. In 5 years, I hope to be employed by a PE/quant firm willing to subsidize my JD. In 10 years, I hope to have already lived in New York and hopefully traveled to 10+ countries.*


## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

*I hope to build my knowledge in python and strengthen my quantitative reasoning and analysis. I would like to strengthen my knowledge in statistics and further my understanding of calculus in options price prediction. I hope to learn more about time-series analyses and compund my understanding of the GARCH/ARCH model. I want to continue applying trading strategies and learning new ones. I believe that this club will fit well into my career path as credit associates/quant firms usually require close ties/knowledge of contracts, potential litigations, and regulations.*

## 4. Current Technical Skills

- *Programming languages (Python, R, etc.): Java:Beginner-intermediate, HTML:Beginner-intermediate, Python:Beginner, SQL:Beginner*
- *R, Matlab: Beginner*
- *Statistical analysis: Beginner-intermediate*
- *Financial modeling: Beginner-intermediate*
- *Machine learning: Beginner*
- *Version control (Git): Beginner-intermediate*

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

*I plan on becoming proficient in Python and I will measure my progress through the model I help build for the final project. I am also taking certificate courses online which should also mark my progress in the language. Along with python, I would like to strengthen my SQL, Java, and start learning C++. Each week, I plan on dedicating 8 horus of time outside of meetings to homework, personal research, courses, and stregnthening trading experience. Along with ceritificate courses through Edx, Coursera, and Linkedin Learning, I would like to continue expanding my knowledge of relevant market industries such as mortgage and ETFs. I continue reading the Financial Times when I can and reading Wall Street Journal daily/every other day. My definition of success in this program is retaining the information taught and being able to apply it.*
